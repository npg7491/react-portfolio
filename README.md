# ðŸš€ A Full-Stack Developer's Portfolio

## Project Overview

This is a high-performance, interactive portfolio built with **React** and **Vite**, serving as a comprehensive showcase of my skills, projects, and professional brand. The application demonstrates my ability to build modern, component-based web applications by successfully converting a pre-existing DOM-centric portfolio into a dynamic and optimized React experience.
